========================================
  HOW TO RUN THE WEB VERSION
========================================

EASIEST METHOD:
--------------
Open Terminal in this folder and run:

    ./start_web.sh

This will:
✓ Set up everything automatically
✓ Install Flask if needed
✓ Start the web server

Then open your browser to: http://localhost:8080


ALTERNATIVE METHOD:
------------------
If the script doesn't work, run these commands:

1. Activate virtual environment:
   source venv/bin/activate

2. Start the server:
   python web_game.py
   
   OR on port 8000:
   python web_game.py 8000

3. Open browser to:
   http://localhost:8080
   
   OR if using port 8000:
   http://localhost:8000


WHAT YOU'LL SEE:
---------------
When you run the server, you'll see:

  ⚔️  REALM OF LEGENDS  ⚔️
  
  🌐 Access the game from:
     Local:    http://localhost:8080
     Network:  http://192.168.x.x:8080
  
  ✨ The game will run in your web browser!
  ✨ Share the Network URL with others on your WiFi!

Then just open your browser and start playing!


TROUBLESHOOTING:
---------------
❌ "Permission denied" when running ./start_web.sh
   → Run: chmod +x start_web.sh

❌ Port 8080 already in use
   → Run on port 8000: python web_game.py 8000
   → Or use the script: ./start_web_8000.sh
   → Or edit web_game.py and change PORT = 8080 to another port
   
❌ Port 5000 was in use
   ✅ Fixed! Now using port 8080 (avoids AirPlay conflict)

❌ Flask not installed error
   → Run: source venv/bin/activate && pip install Flask

❌ Can't connect from browser
   → Make sure the server is running (check terminal)
   → Try http://127.0.0.1:8080 instead
   
❌ Can't access from other devices
   → Check your firewall settings
   → Make sure you're using the Network URL, not localhost
   → Both devices must be on the same WiFi network
